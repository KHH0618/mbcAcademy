 Korea Meteorological Administration Supercomputer No.1: 1999. 200 GigaflopsIn June 1999, Nippon NEC introduced the SX-5 system and used it until December 2005. The theoretical performance is about 200 gigaflops.After the operation, one of the two units is being disposed of and one is being kept for exhibition.Korea Meteorological Administration Supercomputer 2: 2005. 18.5 TeraflopsIn 2005, the Cray X1E system was introduced and operated by Knee Isa in the United States. By 2010, it was operated as an active / backup for the diary side, and used until 2012 to create climate scenarios.theoretical performance 18.5 teraflopsKorea Meteorological Administration Supercomputer No.3 (Haedam, Haeon): 2010. 316 TeraflopsIn 2010, the Cray XE6 system of the US company was introduced and used. It operated until 2015 and was shut down in 2016.,Separated into two systems, "Haeon" and "Haedam", one is supposed to operate as an active and one as a backup; the theoretical performance is called 758 teraflops, which is the combined performance of the two.,The actual performance of each lean pack was 316 teraflops.The shutdown of Unit 3 was found to be recycled and used, but there was no place to take over even if it tried to hand it over at a low price due to the huge maintenance cost of 6 billion won every year.,Only some systems were decided to be used by the Institute of Advanced Study, and the rest eventually became scrap metal.Supercomputer Unit 4 of the Korea Meteorological Administration (Nuri, Miri): 2015. 2.4 petaflopsIn 2015, we are introducing the Cray XC40 system in the US.,The cost of introduction was about 60 billion won. It is named 'Nuri' and 'Miri', and it is divided into active / backup like Unit 3, each with 69,600 cores.,The theoretical performance is called 5.8 petaflops, which is also the combined performance of the two. 
 .4 petaflops, and ranked 28th / 29th respectively at the time of introduction (as of November 2015).,For reference, in 2014, a prototype named 'Uri' was introduced, which seems to have been upgraded to Nuri / Miri (either) after one year of trial operation.As for Unit 4, Pitch One issued a press release claiming that it was "wasting taxpayers' money and suspicion of collusion with the Korea Meteorological Administration," which was misreported.Supercomputer Unit 5 of the Korea Meteorological Administration (Maru, Gru): 2021. 16.7 petaflopsThe Intel Xeon third-generation Ice Lake model, introduced and in use as of 2021, has been given the names Maru and Guru.,It has a real performance of 16.7 petaflops at 300,000 cores each, and was ranked 31st and 32nd in TOP500 as of June 2022.Maru and Gru were supplied by Lenovo, which became a hot topic in public institutions with the introduction of the first Chinese supercomputer in Korea.
